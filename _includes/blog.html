                                <p>The eMunicipality of Bar is an integrated information system which enables more efficient,
                                    responsive and transparent operations of the local administration. It speeds up work
                                    processes, makes databases easily accessible and makes file processing and management
                                    easier.
                                </p>
                                <p> The integrated information system implies that the entire file and document processing is
                                    automated. Hard copies are stored only in the Citizen’s Bureau which operates as a one-stop
                                    shop. Various documents produced upon completion of file/document processing (e.g. permits,
                                    licenses, notices of rejection or acceptance) are automatically stored in appropriate
                                    electronic registers.
                                </p>
                                <p> Citizens are able to obtain quickly and easily information relating to the status of their
                                    requests or documents under processing, while authorized staff can easily oversee the
                                    performance of each employee/department, and supervise file/document processing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The eMunicipality also enables automated management and control of the tax-paying system, public procurements, investments,
                                    as well as human resources and finance management. It also includes databases relating
                                    to all areas of municipal operations.

                                <h4 class="caps">Project background</h4>

                                <p>The Municipality of Bar is one of 21 Montenegrin municipalities. It has a favourable geographical
                                    position: situated in the southern part of the country, Bar represents a marine gateway
                                    to Montenegro and an important economic centre. Tourism is the priority economic sector,
                                    since there are excellent resources for development of this industry:- it includes 45
                                    km of Adriatic coast, 9.5 km of which are sandy beaches; 67 km of Lake Skadar’s shore,
                                    a rich cultural heritage and good sports facilities. Bar has 43 000 inhabitants and it
                                    is 4th most populated municipality in Montenegro. However, over the summer tourist season
                                    the population more than doubles. </p>

                                <p>
                                    Due to the number of inhabitants and temporary residents, as well as the number of companies operating in Bar (10% of the
                                    total number of companies in Montenegro), the Municipality of Bar has a relatively high
                                    number of employees (280) working in six departments: the Agency for Investment and Real
                                    Estate, the Economic and Finance Department, Department of Urban Planning, Housing and
                                    Environmental Protection, Department for Social and General Affairs, Fire Department
                                    and Municipal Police Department.
                                </p>

                                <p>The municipality, despite being considered one of the most developed in the country and a
                                    leader in innovations in terms of the usage of new technologies, has faced the same problems
                                    that many other municipalities worldwide have been facing – insufficient efficiency and
                                    transparency. Therefore, the intent of the municipal authorities was to create a more
                                    efficient administration and business-enabling environment, i.e. to improve delivery
                                    of services, provide full transparency of work processes and reduce business barriers
                                    by applying state-of-the-art information and communication technologies (ICTs). </p>

                                <p>In order to achieve these goals the Municipality of Bar simultaneously implemented two projects:
                                    a guillotine review of regulations and eMunicipality. </p>

                                <p>The guillotine review of regulations is an orderly and transparent process of counting and
                                    then rapidly reviewing regulations against clear criteria, and eliminating those that
                                    are no longer needed. The goal of this of this process is to reduce business barriers.
                                    i.e. create a business enabling environment and stimulate economic growth. As a result
                                    of the guillotine review municipal administrative procedures were shortened and simplified
                                    and a registry containing all formalities and procedures (including all relevant data
                                    such as legal basis, responsible person, deadlines for a certain formality/procedure)
                                    was made available to citizens/clients. </p>

                                <p>Subsequently the eMunicipality project was implemented, and it was performed in two stages.
                                    Firstly, throughout 2008 the computer equipment was procured and the IT communication
                                    network configured. By mid 2009 the first version of software application was delivered
                                    and put in use. </p>

                                <p>The total value of the project, including both hardware and software component, amounted
                                    to circa € 280 000. </p>


                                <p>At the moment the municipality is the only one in Montenegro to have completely automated
                                    its work processes and gathered into one place all the information necessary for smooth
                                    operation of the local administration. The Union of Municipalities of Montenegro recognised
                                    eMunicipality of Bar in November 2010 as a best practice in the introduction of ICTs
                                    in service delivery.</p>

                                <h4>Project objectives</h4>

                                <p>The eMunicipality project was aimed at improving the services and the operations of Bar’s
                                    local administration. Obviously, the implementation of eGovernment projects at all levels
                                    is not a single event, but rather a long-term process of transforming the government
                                    to focus on citizens’ services. </p>

                                <p>Therefore, the initial focus was on creating a paperless government and improving the quality
                                    of services, efficiency and transparency of work processes. Namely, to simplify document
                                    management and processing procedures, increase responsiveness and accountability of the
                                    local administration through the usage of ICTs. The goal was also to enable citizens
                                    to obtain quickly and easily information relating to the status of their requests or
                                    documents under processing. </p>

                                <p>In addition, it was necessary to enable local government and heads of departments to obtain
                                    in a short time full information regarding the status of all documents under processing
                                    and activities undertaken towards their completion. </p>

                                <p>Since there were legacy systems in some of the departments, it was necessary to create an
                                    efficient and functional integrated information system which would enable automated management
                                    and control of the tax-paying system and tax payers, public procurements, investments,
                                    municipal properties, as well as human resource and finance management. </p>

                                <p>The goal of eMunicipalty was also to create good quality databases relating to all areas
                                    of municipal operations, such as: non-governmental organisations (NGOs), cultural and
                                    sports organisations and events, the education system, etc. </p>

                                <p>The application of this integrated information system implies that file and document processing
                                    is entirely automated. In the Citizen’s Bureau, which operates as a one-stop shop, all
                                    documents are scanned and attached to the corresponding files. The same happens with
                                    the documents arriving through the web portal. The hard copies are stored in the Citizen’s
                                    Bureau only, and the processing is entirely automated. </p>

                                <p>At the very moment a client submits a request and the Citizen’s Bureau make a record of the
                                    file, attaching all the corresponding documents as scanned copies, the head of the competent
                                    department is able to forward the file to his/her employees for processing and follow
                                    up the entire procedure. They can check the file status at any time by logging onto the
                                    eMunicipality system using their user names and passwords.</p>

                                <p>The employees can search the files assigned to them using various criteria. They are automatically
                                    informed of the arrival of new documents relating to the files they are processing. </p>

                                <p>Authorized persons can easily check the status of files at a certain point in time and determine
                                    the performance of each employee, as well as each department. </p>

                                <p>The various documents produced upon completion of file processing (e.g. permits, licenses,
                                    notices of rejection or acceptance) are automatically stored in the appropriate registers.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Technology used</h4>
                                <p>The software application was tailor-made to satisfy the specific needs of the Municipality
                                    of Bar. It was developed in the C# programming language, under the .NET framework 3.5.
                                    Microsoft SQL Server 2005, Enterprise edition, was used as a database management system,
                                    while Microsoft Internet Information Server acts as the web server. </p>
                                <p>16 servers were procured in order to provide smooth operation of the entire integrated information
                                    system. Database and web servers were configured in clusters to be able to continue to
                                    operate even in the event of some of them having a systems failure. </p>

                                <p>Uninterrupted power suppliers (UPSs keep the system in function for a certain period of time
                                    in case of a power failure. A generator unit was also procured to serve as an alternative
                                    power supply in case of long duration power outage. </p>

                                <p>All data within the eMunicipality system is copied regularly, and one copy is saved outside
                                    the municipal premises so they can be easily restored even in case of a complete systems
                                    failure. </p>

                                <p>There were legacy systems in some of the departments, and the new software application provided
                                    full integration, i.e. complete data transfer from legacy systems was enabled in order
                                    to secure a functional and efficient fully integrated information system within the municipality.
                                </p>

                                <p>While the first version of the software application was being tested and corrected, staff
                                    training sessions were organised on a “1-to-1” basis –meaning that every employee was
                                    trained at his/her working place. The trainers introduced every employee with the operations
                                    they are allowed / in charge of performing within this information system. The employees
                                    were provided as well with handbooks covering all the operations they had to master.</p>

                                <p>The cost of the development of the software application, which included also staff training,
                                    amounted to circa € 170 000.</p>

                                <h4>Project development and implementation methodology use</h4>

                                <p>The eMunicipality project was implemented in two stages:</p>


                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procurement of computer equipment and configuration
                                    of IT infrastructure</p>

                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software development</p>

                                <p>Both stages were preceded by preparation of adequate design and project documentation. The
                                    implementation of the project was supervised by the municipal working team led by the
                                    Chief Administrator. </p>

                                <p>The software was developed using an agile approach, as it was customized to the needs of
                                    Bar Municipality and it was impossible to determine in advance all the requirements of
                                    the application. The developers needed to have regular contact with municipal staff as
                                    their feedback was of utmost importance. The customized software was chosen for several
                                    reasons: since the Government of Montenegro had signed the license agreement with Microsoft,
                                    we didn’t have any additional costs for using Microsoft’s database management and internet
                                    servers. Besides, at the time of the software application development, the developers
                                    had considered Microsoft’s servers safer then open source ones. </p>

                                <h4>Lessons learned and conclusions</h4>

                                <p>Project experience has shown that in order to be able to successfully implement this kind
                                    of project, decision makers, with power and authority to impose a decision/solution in
                                    case of a problem, must be from among members of the municipal working team, besides
                                    IT personnel. </p>

                                <p>As a result of the guillotine review of regulations we had a registry of all municipal administrative
                                    procedures/formalities, which contained all the relevant data (e.g. what documents are
                                    needed for the issuance of a formality, who is responsible, what is the time limit) prepared
                                    before the start of the eMunicipality project. This registry enabled the developers to
                                    work more quickly, and it prevented manipulation by staff. </p>

                                <p>The major problems encountered during the project implementation were insufficient computer
                                    literacy and obstructions to the usage of the system which one part of the staff and
                                    middle management carried out in order to prevent full transparency of their work and
                                    efficiency. While the first one was easy to solve organizing several ECDL (European Computer
                                    Driving License) courses, we are still dealing with different kind of resistance to the
                                    usage of this information system. </p>

                                <p>NOTE: The full potential and benefits of the eMunicipality project cannot be realised until
                                    the Law on eSignature is fully applied in Montenegro and the municipality is legally
                                    allowed to issue electronic documents. </p>

                                <p></p>

                                <h4>Introduction and related work</h4>

                                <p>Every museum creates and maintains a catalogue of its own assets. This also applies to museum’s
                                    digital resources. Nowadays, there are many ongoing initiatives aimed at digitalizing
                                    national heritage [5], [9], as well as museum collections [1], [4], [6].</p>

                                <h4>Bar County Museum</h4>

                                <p>Bar County Museum was established in 1959. It is housed in the King Nikola’s Palace, i.e.
                                    the summer house of King Nikola of Montenegro, built in 1885. The Museum is situated
                                    on the seafront in the part of town called Topolica. </p>

                                <img class="title_content" src="images/img/writing-samples/ncd-picture-1.png" alt="" />

                                <p>Since 1976 it has been operating within the Bar Cultural Centre. The Museum itself is an
                                    institution of complex organizational structure with several departments: archaeology,
                                    history, history of arts, ethnology and natural history department, and conservation
                                    laboratory, professional library and exhibition hall. </p>

                                <p>Bar County Museum holdings include several collections, the oldest ones being kept within
                                    the Archaeology Department. These collections contain finds from pre-history, ancient
                                    times and middle ages. </p>

                                <p>The History Department collects, preserve and exhibits items related to the political, cultural
                                    and military history of the town. It holds valuable pieces of craft weapons, decorations,
                                    archive documents and photographs, and a considerable collection from the People’s Liberation
                                    War. </p>

                                <p>The Ethnological Department holds several collections of rich and diverse tangible and intangible
                                    heritage related to the local population. The ethnographic material is classified according
                                    to the specific features into collections of national costumes, household items, ethnic
                                    jewelry, culture and customs heritage and economic heritage. </p>

                                <p>The History of Art Department holds collections of paintings, drawings and graphics of mostly
                                    local authors. In addition, there is a small collection of icons and a collection of
                                    items of applied art, mostly authentic objects from King Nikola’s Palace. </p>

                                <p class="caps">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
                                    been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer
                                    took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
                                    not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
                                    unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
                                    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with.</p>

                                <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece
                                    of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,
                                    a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
                                    Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
                                    the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
                                    from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of
                                    Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
                                    ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum
                                    dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
