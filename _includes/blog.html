                                <p>The eMunicipality of Bar is an integrated information system which enables more efficient,
                                    responsive and transparent operations of the local administration. It speeds up work
                                    processes, makes databases easily accessible and makes file processing and management
                                    easier.
                                </p>
                                <p> The integrated information system implies that the entire file and document processing is
                                    automated. Hard copies are stored only in the Citizen’s Bureau which operates as a one-stop
                                    shop. Various documents produced upon completion of file/document processing (e.g. permits,
                                    licenses, notices of rejection or acceptance) are automatically stored in appropriate
                                    electronic registers.
                                </p>
                                <p> Citizens are able to obtain quickly and easily information relating to the status of their
                                    requests or documents under processing, while authorized staff can easily oversee the
                                    performance of each employee/department, and supervise file/document processing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The eMunicipality also enables automated management and control of the tax-paying system, public procurements, investments,
                                    as well as human resources and finance management. It also includes databases relating
                                    to all areas of municipal operations.
                                </p>
                                <h4 class="caps">Project background</h4>

                                <p>The Municipality of Bar is one of 21 Montenegrin municipalities. It has a favourable geographical
                                    position: situated in the southern part of the country, Bar represents a marine gateway
                                    to Montenegro and an important economic centre. Tourism is the priority economic sector,
                                    since there are excellent resources for development of this industry:- it includes 45
                                    km of Adriatic coast, 9.5 km of which are sandy beaches; 67 km of Lake Skadar’s shore,
                                    a rich cultural heritage and good sports facilities. Bar has 43 000 inhabitants and it
                                    is 4th most populated municipality in Montenegro. However, over the summer tourist season
                                    the population more than doubles. </p>

                                <p>
                                    Due to the number of inhabitants and temporary residents, as well as the number of companies operating in Bar (10% of the
                                    total number of companies in Montenegro), the Municipality of Bar has a relatively high
                                    number of employees (280) working in six departments: the Agency for Investment and Real
                                    Estate, the Economic and Finance Department, Department of Urban Planning, Housing and
                                    Environmental Protection, Department for Social and General Affairs, Fire Department
                                    and Municipal Police Department.
                                </p>

                                <p>The municipality, despite being considered one of the most developed in the country and a
                                    leader in innovations in terms of the usage of new technologies, has faced the same problems
                                    that many other municipalities worldwide have been facing – insufficient efficiency and
                                    transparency. Therefore, the intent of the municipal authorities was to create a more
                                    efficient administration and business-enabling environment, i.e. to improve delivery
                                    of services, provide full transparency of work processes and reduce business barriers
                                    by applying state-of-the-art information and communication technologies (ICTs). </p>

                                <p>In order to achieve these goals the Municipality of Bar simultaneously implemented two projects:
                                    a guillotine review of regulations and eMunicipality. </p>

                                <p>The guillotine review of regulations is an orderly and transparent process of counting and
                                    then rapidly reviewing regulations against clear criteria, and eliminating those that
                                    are no longer needed. The goal of this of this process is to reduce business barriers.
                                    i.e. create a business enabling environment and stimulate economic growth. As a result
                                    of the guillotine review municipal administrative procedures were shortened and simplified
                                    and a registry containing all formalities and procedures (including all relevant data
                                    such as legal basis, responsible person, deadlines for a certain formality/procedure)
                                    was made available to citizens/clients. </p>

                                <p>Subsequently the eMunicipality project was implemented, and it was performed in two stages.
                                    Firstly, throughout 2008 the computer equipment was procured and the IT communication
                                    network configured. By mid 2009 the first version of software application was delivered
                                    and put in use. </p>

                                <p>The total value of the project, including both hardware and software component, amounted
                                    to circa € 280 000. </p>


                                <p>At the moment the municipality is the only one in Montenegro to have completely automated
                                    its work processes and gathered into one place all the information necessary for smooth
                                    operation of the local administration. The Union of Municipalities of Montenegro recognised
                                    eMunicipality of Bar in November 2010 as a best practice in the introduction of ICTs
                                    in service delivery.</p>

                                <h4>Project objectives</h4>

                                <p>The eMunicipality project was aimed at improving the services and the operations of Bar’s
                                    local administration. Obviously, the implementation of eGovernment projects at all levels
                                    is not a single event, but rather a long-term process of transforming the government
                                    to focus on citizens’ services. </p>

                                <p>Therefore, the initial focus was on creating a paperless government and improving the quality
                                    of services, efficiency and transparency of work processes. Namely, to simplify document
                                    management and processing procedures, increase responsiveness and accountability of the
                                    local administration through the usage of ICTs. The goal was also to enable citizens
                                    to obtain quickly and easily information relating to the status of their requests or
                                    documents under processing. </p>

                                <p>In addition, it was necessary to enable local government and heads of departments to obtain
                                    in a short time full information regarding the status of all documents under processing
                                    and activities undertaken towards their completion. </p>

                                <p>Since there were legacy systems in some of the departments, it was necessary to create an
                                    efficient and functional integrated information system which would enable automated management
                                    and control of the tax-paying system and tax payers, public procurements, investments,
                                    municipal properties, as well as human resource and finance management. </p>

                                <p>The goal of eMunicipalty was also to create good quality databases relating to all areas
                                    of municipal operations, such as: non-governmental organisations (NGOs), cultural and
                                    sports organisations and events, the education system, etc. </p>

                                <p>The application of this integrated information system implies that file and document processing
                                    is entirely automated. In the Citizen’s Bureau, which operates as a one-stop shop, all
                                    documents are scanned and attached to the corresponding files. The same happens with
                                    the documents arriving through the web portal. The hard copies are stored in the Citizen’s
                                    Bureau only, and the processing is entirely automated. </p>

                                <p>At the very moment a client submits a request and the Citizen’s Bureau make a record of the
                                    file, attaching all the corresponding documents as scanned copies, the head of the competent
                                    department is able to forward the file to his/her employees for processing and follow
                                    up the entire procedure. They can check the file status at any time by logging onto the
                                    eMunicipality system using their user names and passwords.</p>

                                <p>The employees can search the files assigned to them using various criteria. They are automatically
                                    informed of the arrival of new documents relating to the files they are processing. </p>

                                <p>Authorized persons can easily check the status of files at a certain point in time and determine
                                    the performance of each employee, as well as each department. </p>

                                <p>The various documents produced upon completion of file processing (e.g. permits, licenses,
                                    notices of rejection or acceptance) are automatically stored in the appropriate registers.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Technology used</h4>
                                <p>The software application was tailor-made to satisfy the specific needs of the Municipality
                                    of Bar. It was developed in the C# programming language, under the .NET framework 3.5.
                                    Microsoft SQL Server 2005, Enterprise edition, was used as a database management system,
                                    while Microsoft Internet Information Server acts as the web server. </p>
                                <p>16 servers were procured in order to provide smooth operation of the entire integrated information
                                    system. Database and web servers were configured in clusters to be able to continue to
                                    operate even in the event of some of them having a systems failure. </p>

                                <p>Uninterrupted power suppliers (UPSs keep the system in function for a certain period of time
                                    in case of a power failure. A generator unit was also procured to serve as an alternative
                                    power supply in case of long duration power outage. </p>

                                <p>All data within the eMunicipality system is copied regularly, and one copy is saved outside
                                    the municipal premises so they can be easily restored even in case of a complete systems
                                    failure. </p>

                                <p>There were legacy systems in some of the departments, and the new software application provided
                                    full integration, i.e. complete data transfer from legacy systems was enabled in order
                                    to secure a functional and efficient fully integrated information system within the municipality.
                                </p>

                                <p>While the first version of the software application was being tested and corrected, staff
                                    training sessions were organised on a “1-to-1” basis –meaning that every employee was
                                    trained at his/her working place. The trainers introduced every employee with the operations
                                    they are allowed / in charge of performing within this information system. The employees
                                    were provided as well with handbooks covering all the operations they had to master.</p>

                                <p>The cost of the development of the software application, which included also staff training,
                                    amounted to circa € 170 000.</p>

                                <h4>Project development and implementation methodology use</h4>

                                <p>The eMunicipality project was implemented in two stages:</p>


                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procurement of computer equipment and configuration
                                    of IT infrastructure</p>

                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software development</p>

                                <p>Both stages were preceded by preparation of adequate design and project documentation. The
                                    implementation of the project was supervised by the municipal working team led by the
                                    Chief Administrator. </p>

                                <p>The software was developed using an agile approach, as it was customized to the needs of
                                    Bar Municipality and it was impossible to determine in advance all the requirements of
                                    the application. The developers needed to have regular contact with municipal staff as
                                    their feedback was of utmost importance. The customized software was chosen for several
                                    reasons: since the Government of Montenegro had signed the license agreement with Microsoft,
                                    we didn’t have any additional costs for using Microsoft’s database management and internet
                                    servers. Besides, at the time of the software application development, the developers
                                    had considered Microsoft’s servers safer then open source ones. </p>

                                <h4>Lessons learned and conclusions</h4>

                                <p>Project experience has shown that in order to be able to successfully implement this kind
                                    of project, decision makers, with power and authority to impose a decision/solution in
                                    case of a problem, must be from among members of the municipal working team, besides
                                    IT personnel. </p>

                                <p>As a result of the guillotine review of regulations we had a registry of all municipal administrative
                                    procedures/formalities, which contained all the relevant data (e.g. what documents are
                                    needed for the issuance of a formality, who is responsible, what is the time limit) prepared
                                    before the start of the eMunicipality project. This registry enabled the developers to
                                    work more quickly, and it prevented manipulation by staff. </p>

                                <p>The major problems encountered during the project implementation were insufficient computer
                                    literacy and obstructions to the usage of the system which one part of the staff and
                                    middle management carried out in order to prevent full transparency of their work and
                                    efficiency. While the first one was easy to solve organizing several ECDL (European Computer
                                    Driving License) courses, we are still dealing with different kind of resistance to the
                                    usage of this information system. </p>

                                <p>NOTE: The full potential and benefits of the eMunicipality project cannot be realised until
                                    the Law on eSignature is fully applied in Montenegro and the municipality is legally
                                    allowed to issue electronic documents. </p>

                                <h4>1. Introduction and related work</h4>

                                <p>Every museum creates and maintains a catalogue of its own assets. This also applies to museum’s
                                    digital resources. Nowadays, there are many ongoing initiatives aimed at digitalizing
                                    national heritage [5], [9], as well as museum collections [1], [4], [6].</p>

                                <h4>2. Bar County Museum</h4>

                                <p>Bar County Museum was established in 1959. It is housed in the King Nikola’s Palace, i.e.
                                    the summer house of King Nikola of Montenegro, built in 1885. The Museum is situated
                                    on the seafront in the part of town called Topolica. </p>

                                <img class="slika_u_clanku" src="images/img/writing-samples/ncd-picture-1.png" alt="" />

                                <p>Since 1976 it has been operating within the Bar Cultural Centre. The Museum itself is an
                                    institution of complex organizational structure with several departments: archaeology,
                                    history, history of arts, ethnology and natural history department, and conservation
                                    laboratory, professional library and exhibition hall. </p>

                                <p>Bar County Museum holdings include several collections, the oldest ones being kept within
                                    the Archaeology Department. These collections contain finds from pre-history, ancient
                                    times and middle ages. </p>

                                <p>The History Department collects, preserve and exhibits items related to the political, cultural
                                    and military history of the town. It holds valuable pieces of craft weapons, decorations,
                                    archive documents and photographs, and a considerable collection from the People’s Liberation
                                    War. </p>

                                <p>The Ethnological Department holds several collections of rich and diverse tangible and intangible
                                    heritage related to the local population. The ethnographic material is classified according
                                    to the specific features into collections of national costumes, household items, ethnic
                                    jewelry, culture and customs heritage and economic heritage. </p>

                                <p>The History of Art Department holds collections of paintings, drawings and graphics of mostly
                                    local authors. In addition, there is a small collection of icons and a collection of
                                    items of applied art, mostly authentic objects from King Nikola’s Palace. </p>

                                <p>The Natural History Department collects and preserves paleontology and a mineralogy-petrography
                                    items within several collections.</p>

                                <p>The current permanent display in the Museum was installed in 1999 and designed in such a
                                    manner to present chronologically the continuing development and specific features of
                                    tangible and intangible heritage of Bar. The displayed artifacts represent diverse periods:
                                    prehistory, ancient times, Middle Ages, the period of Turkish dominance and the reign
                                    of King Nikola. </p>

                                <p>Over the years, the Museum has established fruitful cooperation with numerous institutions
                                    of a kind, as well as with several established international universities. The cooperation
                                    with universities includes mainly joint archeological researches of rich cultural and
                                    historical heritage of Bar area. Currently the archeologists of Bar County Museum are
                                    cooperating with their colleagues from the University of Venice – Ca’ Foscari (Italy)
                                    in researching the site of the Old Town of Bar, one of the greatest archeological sites
                                    located within walls in the world. The cooperation with experts form the University of
                                    Southampton (Great Britain) is aimed at exploring the underwater archeological heritage.
                                    This research is the first underwater archeology research in Montenegro. </p>


                                <p>At the time being, the Museum’s collections are being catalogued in the old-fashion, paper
                                    way, as it is described on the picture that follows. </p>

                                <img class="slika_u_clanku" src="images/img/writing-samples/ncd-picture-3.png" alt="" />


                                <p>The primary goal of this pilot project is to find out the optimal way of digitalizing and
                                    cataloguing museum resources, using modern information technology. </p>

                                <h4>3. Digital asset management (DAM) </h4>

                                <p>
                                    <strong>Digital asset management (DAM)</strong> consists of management tasks and decisions surrounding
                                    the ingestion, annotation, cataloguing, storage, retrieval and distribution of digital
                                    assets [11].
                                    </strong>Digital asset management systems (DAMS)</strong> include computer software and
                                    hardware systems which support the process of digital asset management. </p>
                                <p>The term "digital asset management" (DAM) also refers to the protocol for downloading, renaming,
                                    backing up, rating, grouping, archiving, optimizing, maintaining, thinning, and exporting
                                    files. </p>

                                <p>Generally, the
                                    <strong>"asset"</strong> being managed is collected and stored in a digital format. There is
                                    usually a target version - referred to as "essence" - generally the highest-resolution
                                    and highest-fidelity representation. The asset is detailed by its
                                    <strong>metadata</strong>. Metadata is the description of the asset and the description depth
                                    can vary depending on the needs of the system, designer, or user. </p>

                                <p>Metadata can include, but is not limited to, the description of: asset content (what is in
                                    the package?); the means of encoding/decoding (e.g. JPEG, tar, MPEG 2); provenance (history
                                    to point of capture); ownership; rights of access; as well as many others. There exist
                                    some pre-defined standards and templates for metadata such as Dublin Core and PBCore.
                                </p>

                                <p>If systems contain large-size asset essences, such as MPEG 2 and JPEG2000 for the cases of
                                    images and video, there are usually related "proxy" copies of the essence. A proxy copy
                                    is a lower-resolution representation of the essence that can be used as a reference in
                                    order to reduce the overall bandwidth requirements of the DAM system infrastructure.
                                </p>

                                <p>The following broad categories of digital asset management systems may be distinguished [11]:
                                </p>

                                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brand asset management systems, with a focus on facilitation
                                    of content re-use within large organizations. </p>

                                <p>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Library asset management systems, with a focus on storage and retrieval of large amounts
                                    of infrequently changing media assets, for example in video or photo archiving.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Production asset management systems focus on managing assets as they are being created
                                    for a digital media production (video game, 3D feature film, animation, visualeffects
                                    shots, etc.) They usually include work-flow and project-management features.
                                </p>

                                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digital supply chain services, pushing digital content
                                    out to digital retailers (e.g. music, videos and games). </p>

                                <p>DAM software may be open source or proprietary. </p>

                                <p>According to [3], the heart of DAM systems should have the following set of core content
                                    management functionalities (some native, some perhaps from 3rd parties):
                                </p>
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repository This is core of any system;
                                    it builds a representation of the content utilizing a relational database or file system,
                                    or some combination. This includes basic repository services, such as version control,
                                    categorization, upload, and download.
                                </p>
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The metadata index This includes descriptors,
                                    administrative data as well as versions, and other hierarchical, peer to peer, parent
                                    child or lineage relationships.
                                </p>
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The search engine This feature performs
                                    searches against the above-defined index and repository.
                                </p>
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The access and rights subsystem Privileges
                                    and permissions that define who can see and operate with different objects.
                                </p>
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workflow or collaboration engine Scheduling
                                    and definition of tasks in serial or parallel progression. </p>

                                <h4>4. Desirable characteristic for successful DAMS</h4>

                                <p>Nowadays, there are many comparative analyses of different digital libraries [2] and digital
                                    asset management systems [3].
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Software that catalogue and manage digital resources (DAMS) should have following features (ordered from the most important
                                    to less important ones):
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
                                    <em>Ability to upload and store digital resources</em>. Software which manages digital resources
                                    should have all the facilities needed to manage many different types of media across
                                    the organization. Uploaded resources should be kept safe and without loss of quality.
                                    It should also allow automatic extraction of digital resource‘s properties and attaching
                                    extracted properties (metadata) to uploaded digital resource (asset).
                                </p>
                                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
                                    <em>Ability to add various properties to uploaded digital resource</em>. DAMS should allow
                                    end user to catalogue uploaded digital resource e.g. to attach various metadata values
                                    to uploaded digital resource. Specific 'tags' can be added to digital resource to provide
                                    users with search controls that help them to operate the system with minimal effort and
                                    expertise
                                </p>
                                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
                                    <em>Ability to work on the web</em>. Digital Asset Manager should allow end user to interact
                                    with the system (upload data, catalogue data, make inquires) by using web as communication
                                    channel.
                                </p>
                                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
                                    <em>Advanced Search</em>. Digital Asset Manager should provide users with search technology
                                    that enables them to quickly and easily locate the media files they need. Also, Digital
                                    Asset Manager should permit users to browse for, as well as search for media files by
                                    using ‘tags’.
                                </p>
                                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
                                    <em>Powerful Media Processing Features</em>. Digital Asset Manager should handle most common
                                    media types, including: photos, video, audio and print artwork. It should autogenerate
                                    thumbnails and previews for most supported media types including bandwidth intensive
                                    media like high definition (HD) video or high resolution artwork.
                                </p>
                                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.
                                    <em>Easy To Use</em>. User interfaces should be designed to be intuitive and utilize GUI
                                    models that users are already familiar with. It should also offer a comprehensive and
                                    contextsensitive help system that will guide even the most novice user through key tasks
                                    and system functions.
                                </p>
                                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.
                                    <em>Flexible and Configurable</em>. Media and metadata management tools should be flexible,
                                    which means that media files can be hidden or shown to certain users, can be displayed
                                    with or without a watermark (includes video) and can be restricted from download or flagged
                                    for approval before publication. Likewise, administrators should have ability to revise
                                    and add metadata fields to media files with far greater ease and control, ensuring that
                                    media is catalogued, presented and made available to users exactly as the business requires.
                                </p>
                                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.
                                    <em>Scalable</em>. Offered solution should have very scalable nature and the whole system
                                    have to perform well under very heavy load (e.g. hundreds of concurrent user). Also,
                                    it should perform well even in the case when demands arise very quickly. The architecture
                                    of Digital Asset Manager should be robust, and implementation should be without ‘narrow
                                    throats’.
                                </p>
                                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.
                                    <em>Possibility of automatic interchange</em>. Offered software should have a way to interchange
                                    digital resources and/or metadata in automatic manner. In other words, the system should
                                    have possibility to communicate with other systems, or with digital resources register,
                                    like the register that is proposed in [10].
                                </p>
                                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.
                                    <em>Ability for further changes and improvements</em>. Digital Asset Manager will be changed
                                    and improved during years. In order to achieve that goal, source of the system should
                                    be available for further improvements and modifications.
                                </p>
                                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.
                                    <em>Multiple brands under multiple domains in the same core system</em>. Digital Asset Manager
                                    should be structured in such a way that each brand can have its own styling (logo, images,
                                    colors), a unique domain name (rather than a sub-domain), different metadata, terminology
                                    and home page. All digital resources and users from one brand are separated from those
                                    in other brands, so end users do not ever need to be aware that the system is shared.
                                </p>
                                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.
                                    <em>Single sign-on</em>. The system should provide a single sign-on services to the entire
                                    organization. It should simultaneously support access from approved external users without
                                    internal network access.
                                </p>
                                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.
                                    <em>Streamlined Cataloguing</em>. Administrators should be able to catalogue media easily
                                    and quickly, yet still produce the comprehensive metadata needed for fast and accurate
                                    search results. The streamlining features include: digital asset cross-referencing, metadata
                                    templates, scheduled uploading and bulk uploading.
                                </p>
                                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.
                                    <em>Copyright and Brand Control</em>. To better protect the copyright and reduce the risk
                                    of license breach or brand misuse the Digital Asset Manager should enable administrators
                                    to control media use - protecting against unauthorized downloads, applying watermarks
                                    or suppressing media previews and files for selected user groups on a per asset basis.
                                    Furthermore, the system should support publications and expiry features.
                                </p>
                                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.
                                    <em>Comprehensive Statistics and Reporting</em>. Reporting feature enables administrators
                                    to rapidly generate reports on media and system usage, such as login and registration
                                    statistics, media download statistics and user audit trails. This information assists
                                    administrators in troubleshooting and assessing the need for media or system features
                                    into the future.

                                <h4>5. Open source software </h4>

                                <p>The paper [7] states that there are three main types of software product firms: </p>
                                <p>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Closed source firms own all competitively differentiating software components their products are
                                    based on (e.g. : Microsoft Windows, Oracle’s database and SAP Business Suite). </p>
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Single-vendor open source firms also own all competitively differentiating
                                    components, but they make some of these components available as open source (like: Alfresco,
                                    Jaspersoft’s BI, etc.).
                                </p>
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Open source distributors integrate a large set of open source
                                    components and distribute the assembly for free. The distributors typically don’t own
                                    these components (for instance, Red Hat’s Linux).

                                    <p>An open-source software is available in a source code form: the source code and certain
                                        other rights normally reserved for copyright holders are provided under a software
                                        license that permits users to study, change, improve and also to distribute the software
                                        [12].

                                        An open source software is very often developed in a public, collaborative manner. It doesn't just mean access to the source
                                        code. The distribution terms of an open-source program must comply with the following
                                        criteria.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        According to [7], in order to be an open source, all of the terms below must be applied together, and in all cases. For example,
                                        they must be applied to derived versions of a program as well as the original program.
                                        It's not sufficient to apply some and not others, and it's not sufficient for the
                                        terms to apply only some of the time. </p>

                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.
                                        <strong>Free Redistribution</strong>. The license may not restrict any party from selling
                                        or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution
                                        containing programs from several different sources. The license may not require a
                                        royalty or other fee for such sale.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.
                                        <strong>Source Code</strong>. The program must include source code and must allow distribution
                                        in source code as well as in a compiled form. Where some form of a product is not
                                        distributed with the source code, there must be a well-publicized means of downloading
                                        the source code, without charge, via the Internet. The source code must be the preferred
                                        form that a programmer could modify the program.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.
                                        <strong>Derived Works</strong>. The license must allow modifications and derived works, requiring
                                        that derived code will be distributed under the same terms as the license of the
                                        original software. The software has little use if you can't maintain it (fix bugs,
                                        port to new systems, make improvements), and modification is necessary for maintenance.
                                        The intent here is to allow modifications of any sort. It must be allowed for a modified
                                        work to be distributed under the same license terms as the original work.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.
                                        <strong>Integrity of the Author's Source Code</strong>. The license may restrict source code
                                        from being distributed in a modified form only if it allows the distribution of "patch
                                        files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time.
                                        The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source
                                        code. The license may require that derived works have a different name or version
                                        number from the original software.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.
                                        <strong>No Discrimination against Persons or Groups</strong>. The license must not discriminate
                                        any person or group of persons.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.
                                        <strong>No Discrimination against Fields of Endeavor</strong>. The license must not restrict
                                        anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example,
                                        it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used
                                        for genetic research.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.
                                        <strong>Distribution of License</strong>. The rights attached to the program must apply to
                                        all to whom the program is redistributed, without the need for execution of an additional
                                        license by those parties.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.
                                        <strong>License Must Not Be Specific to a Product</strong>. The rights attached to the program
                                        must not depend on the program's being part of a particular software distribution.
                                        If the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within
                                        the terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is redistributed
                                        should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original
                                        software distribution. This means you can't restrict a product that is identified
                                        as open source to be free only if you use it with a particular brand of Linux distribution,
                                        etc. It must remain free if you separate it from the software distribution it came
                                        with.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.
                                        <strong>License Must Not Contaminate Other Software</strong>. The license must not place
                                        restrictions on other software distributed along with the licensed software. For
                                        example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same
                                        medium must be opensource software. </p>

                                    <h4>6. FocusOPEN Digital Asset Manager</h4>

                                    <p>In the case of digitalizing the assets of the Bar County Museum we decided to implement
                                        the pilot project with open source software for DAM, instead of building our own
                                        proprietary software. </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The requirements that should have a successful DAMS, enlisted in section 4, are hard to achieve for the software build from
                                        the scratch. To be more precise, that requirements are almost impossible to achieve
                                        in adequate time frame and with resources that are available to us. </p>
                                    <p>
                                        On the other way, the limitations arising from open source license don’t prevent us from upgrading and changing downloaded
                                        solution. In other words, we can upgrade and change downloaded open source solution,
                                        without breaching license agreement. During evaluation of possible candidates, one
                                        open-source product has drowned our attention – an open source version of FocusOPEN
                                        Digital Asset Manager fulfills almost all requirements enlisted in section 4. </p>
                                    <p>
                                        According to the classification from the beginning of Section 5, the selected software product is created by a single-vendor
                                        open source firm, which owns all competitively differentiating components, but it
                                        makes the FocusOPEN available as open source. </p>
                                    <p>
                                        FocusOPEN Digital Asset Manager is a digital asset management solution designed to help businesses make more of their media,
                                        from managing brands to distributing marketing collateral or other media assets.
                                    </p>

                                <p class="caps">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
                                    been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer
                                    took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
                                    not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
                                    unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
                                    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with.</p>

                                <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece
                                    of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,
                                    a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
                                    Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
                                    the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
                                    from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of
                                    Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
                                    ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum
                                    dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
